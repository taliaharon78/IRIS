## AI-Powered Decision Support System for Therapists of Autistic Children

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled applications that were not feasible just a few years ago. Large Language Models (LLMs) can now understand human psychological states and social interactions, identify adversarial environments, and be taught, personalized, and customized.

IRIS, an application that leverages AI and NLP within a decision support system (DSS) helps verbal autistic children navigate social interactions. IRIS provides therapists for autistic children (mainly speech therapists and psychologists) with a toolkit powered by real-life events. Autistic children often misinterpret social situations, and therapists miss valuable information when relying solely on the childâ€™s version of events.

IRIS acts as a reliable witness and documentarian. Triggered by a schedule, specific words, or recognized emotions from conversation analysis, it documents these events and provides therapists with summaries and AI-generated visual stories, facilitating personalized support.

During the training period, IRIS serves as a passive decision support system. Therapists provide feedback on summaries, visual stories, and alternative solutions suggested by IRIS to refine the model. Our vision is for IRIS to evolve into an active, real-time support system for autistic children, acting as a reliable agent on behalf of the therapist.
